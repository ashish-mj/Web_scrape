Lettering with a Kindred Spirit,5.0,Rated 5.0 out of 5 from 9 reviews.,"Montgomery, United States",Airbnb Online Experiences,"We will dive into the elegant art of Hand-lettering. Similar to calligraphy in style, yet different in materials, lettering only requires basic washable markers, sharpies, or your favorite pen. We will begin by exploring the basic strokes of lettering. From there we will examine different styles to diversify our artwork. Once we feel comfortable with some of the basics, we will begin lettering words and longer quotes. Ultimately, you will create a card or small poster that you feel proud of, and that represents you well.",Online experience hosted by Kindred,Host on Airbnb since 2018,9 Reviews,Identity verified,"Hey, I'm Kindred--elementary and high school teacher by day and master hand-letterer by night!

Guided Meditation with Sleepy Sheep,4.97,Rated 4.97 out of 5 from 432 reviews.,"Stirling, United Kingdom",Airbnb Online Experiences,"This is a virtual, online experience with Hamish, Dougal, and Lochie the sheep.

I will tell you some sheep stories, and you can ask me questions. Please bring your own sheep fun fact to share, and use the chat sidebar to engage with fellow guests. These baaaad boys have appalling table manners, so you might like to join them with your own snacks.  After they have eaten, these lovelies come right up to the camera for snuggles. It is very calming to become part of the flock and to look into the half-closed eyes of a contented sheep. We’ll take a cue from these cuddly creatures, learning some therapeutic breathing exercises to relax and virtually escape to the calm of our farm. My yoga instructor daughter Rivkah will then lead a 10-15 minute mindful meditation with the sounds of nature to soothe you.  We'll teach you some de-stress techniques to use in your daily life.

Now Airbnb gives me the opportunity to do the class online, being able to take this family recipe anywhere in the world. To start, I will send you the list of ingredients, so we can review the recipe together and during the class we will make the empanadas. The ingredients are very easy to find: for dough (flour, egg, butter, milk), the filling or ""pine"" (meat, onion, raisins, olives and egg) together with the famous Chilean Pebre, a rich chopped sauce of fresh ingredients (tomato, onion and coriander). If they do not have them we can make other variants. Normally traditional empanadas are with beef, but we can adapt to your ingredients or personal tastes, and make them vegetarian, chicken and more. While we cook, we can have a drink and share anecdotes from Chile and some tips for when they come. We will cook the ingredients of the filling, we will make the dough and we will teach them to organize the elements to fill them, close them and make the traditional shapes that identify them. Then we heat the oven to the proper temperature and bake until golden. We will also make the pebre that accompanies them, to finally taste the traditional Chilean Pine Empanada with Pebre.

It was developed by Dr Ronald Ruden who made the connection between therapeutic touch and its positive impact on the brain.  By taking a few key concepts from mainstream science Dr. Ruden came up with protocols to assist the release of traumatic memories easily, effectively, and permanently. The name 'Havening' was given to indicate the perceived sense of safety his patients experienced when applying Havening Touch™ (HT). We will spend time together virtually in Zoom where:- I will demonstrate how HT can calm the mind and body. We will then learn more about the history of Havening and how it became so popular with celebrities like Justin Bieber.   I will walk you through an  'Event Havening' protocol to clear a specific memory of a time you felt anxious or fearful.  We will share and gain insights from each other of the impact on the original memory before and after applying HT.

I see floral design as a branch of beaux-arts. In fact, flowers can touch us as much as paintings do; they influence the vibes of a space, and they bright up our mood. Nonetheless, floral art is still far from being recognized in its cultural value from the broad audience; let's discover it together through my unique vision within a creative, judgement-less, and inspiring context.  The experience consists of 3 parts:  1) I will show a floral painting and go over its formal elements, and the story of the painter who made it. During this phase, I will teach you how to look at any painting with a particular “observer method”, to capture the artwork's beauty at best.  2) After that, we’ll make the flower arrangement inspired by the painting! This is the longest part of the workshop, where I’ll share all the basics of floristry, plus some fun facts about flowers and techniques.  3) I will conclude the workshop showing some pics of my favorite botanical artists that inspire my art practice, and even a personal project that taught me how to use creativity as a form of resilience.

I’ll help with perspective, hints, and tips to help you make your dream come true no matter where you are or what you have.  My goal through this experience is to share three key ingredients that will let you use what you have to take your life to the next level. To help share these ingredients, I’ll use some examples from my often bumbled quest to the Olympics. As storytelling is a huge part of Polynesian culture, I’ll be telling my story around a wooden kava bowl. You're encouraged to have some form of healthy drink ready to 'inu' with me each time we share an experience. I will show you the importance of resourcefulness over resources. Throughout, there will be time for many of you to ask questions and pick my brain on how to overcome any specific motivation-based challenges you may have. As a heads up, expect that my experience on July 26 at 10:00am London time will be streamed live for more fans to watch both on Airbnb.com and on YouTube, so if you book to join me, you'll also get to be part of the stream.

Sit and Get Fit with Adaptive Yoga,5.0,Rated 5.0 out of 5 from 4 reviews.,"London, United Kingdom",Airbnb Online Experiences,"Gentle but effective workouts - suitable for people with physical restrictions.  In this class we practise 'Adaptive Yoga’ which is designed to make yoga accessible to more people, especially those who have injuries, limitations, disabilities or those who are elderly. This course is for anyone wanting to reclaim mobility in a gentle way.  Yoga isn't practised only on a mat. You can incorporate yoga poses in everyday tasks like brushing your teeth, washing the dishes, or sitting on the couch!  In fact, the couch adds a nice layer of resistance, which will help you get the maximum benefit from each pose whilst being supported and comfy.  We will begin the practice with breathing exercises to switch the body from an alert state to a calm state, followed by gentle movement to strengthen the mind-body connection, and we’ll end with a short meditation to help boost the immune system.  This is a judgment-free-zone and you are encouraged to go at your own pace! Each workout can be 'adapted' to suit your requirements so you’ll find yourself enjoying exercise – at the level you truly need. 50% of my fee is being donated to the GoFundMe campaign, Adaptive Yoga LIVE, a fitness initiative launched for the disabled community during COVID-19 to help reduce stress during self-isolation.
